This is the mini project on Naive Bayes algorithm for text analysis.
In this mini project I have used scikit learn MAchine learning library.
The preprocessing is done in email_preprocess.py in tools directory.
The Dataset used is enron email data.Here I predicted the email writer 
from the email body using Naive Bayes Algorithm.
I have achieved 97.32% of Accuracy.
Dataset can be found at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/enron_mail_20150507.tgz
